  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Biryani is your favourite chicken curry (or vegetable or other protein of choice) buried under a mound of delicately spiced fluffy rice, all made in a pot. The rice is steamed over a low heat so it absorbs the flavours of the curry bubbling away underneath.</p>

          <li>2 tbsp warm water</li>
        <h4>Biryani</h4>
          <li>1 cup coriander</li>

        <h4>Garnish</h4>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h4>Par Boiled Rice:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Mix Marinade in a large pot (about 26cm / 11" diameter). Add chicken and coat well. Marinade 20 minutes to overnight.</li>
          <li>Bring 3 litres / 3 quarts water to the boil, add salt and spices.</li>
          <li>Add rice, bring back up to the boil then cook for 4 minutes, or until rice is just cooked still a bit firm in the middle. Rice will taste salty at this stage, disappears in next stage of cooking.</li>
          <li>Drain immediately. Set aside. (Note 10 re: leaving whole spices in)</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Crispy Onions</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Cook onion, in batches, for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden brown. Don't burn - they become bitter.</li>
          <li>Remove onto paper towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining onion.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Saffron</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Place in bowl, leave for 10 minutes</li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Biryani</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Place pot with chicken in it onto a stove over medium heat. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Remove lid. Cook for 5 minutes, turning chicken twice.</li>
          <li>Remove from heat.</li>
          <li>Turn chicken so skin side is down - it should cover most of the base of the pot.</li>
          <li>Scatter over half the onion then half the coriander.</li>
          <li>Top with all the rice. Gently pat down and flatten surface.</li>
          <li>Drizzle saffron across rice surface in random pattern, then drizzle over ghee.</li>
          <li>Place lid on. Return to stove over medium heat.</li>
          <li>As soon as you see steam, turn down to low then cook for 25 minutes.</li>
          <li>Remove from stove, rest with lid on for 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To Serve</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Aim to serve it so you get nice patches of yellow rice, white rice, the curry stained rice + chicken (rather than all mixed up). To do this, use a large spoon and dig deep into the pot, and try to scoop up as much as you can in one scoop.</li>
          <li>Turn out into bowl - or onto platter. Garnish with remaining onion and coriander with yoghurt on the side (see Note 7 for Minted Yoghurt)</li>
        </ol>
